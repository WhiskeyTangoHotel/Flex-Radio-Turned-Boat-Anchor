The Flex Radio 6400 is an amazing state of the art ham radio transceiver 
with so many modern bells and whistles than no normal human could ever get 
around to using them all.   But, sometimes you long to send out that
relaxing and warm sound that could only be achieved from a vintage "boat anchor" 
radio.  A signature trademark of these rigs is their inability to hold steady
on a frequency.  This results in frequency drift.  This 'feature' is lost in 
modern rigs like the Flex Radio.  So what's a modern ham to do when that 
vintage sound is desired?
